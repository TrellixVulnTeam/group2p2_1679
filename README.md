# Anime Library

## Project Description

Anime Library is a personal anime library tracker which uses the robust jikan.moe API to automatically fill in data about the anime you choose to track. Anime Library allows you to track the viewed status of your library and review anime, as well as view other usersâ€™ libraries and reviews. Additionally, there is a recommender to randomly suggest anime from outside your library that you might enjoy.
